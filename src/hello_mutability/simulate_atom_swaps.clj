; in this exercise we have one big atom
; with multiple attributes being manipulated
; creating a busy-retry scenario

; eg.: when two people are going to different queues at the same time
; the later will suffer a retry because the atom changed its state
; this is bad and poorly efficient also.

; considering this scenario
; would be better to have split atoms with  smaller scope / responsibility
; when data from one queue is being moved to another
; we only need to "lock" both involved

; !BUT! there is no support for transactions between two atoms
; lets use another structure!
